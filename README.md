# zomato-data-insights
This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering workflow performed on the Zomato Restaurants Dataset.
The project aims to uncover insights about global restaurant trends, ratings, pricing patterns, cuisines, and location-based behaviors — and prepare the data for further modeling.
🎯 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw restaurant data

Merge datasets to enrich country-level information

Perform exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights

Create new features for future machine learning models

Identify key business trends in the restaurant industry

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python	Core language
Pandas & NumPy	Data processing & manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn	Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook	Exploratory workflow environment
✨ Key Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and inconsistent values

Handled missing values

Standardized text fields

2️⃣ Data Enrichment

Merged Zomato dataset with Country Code mapping

Extracted insights at both local & global level

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed:

Most popular cuisines globally

Cost distribution across countries and cities

Relationship between ratings and price levels

Restaurant density by region

4️⃣ Feature Engineering

Created features like:

Cuisine Count

Cost Category (Low / Mid / High)

Rating Quality Labels

Encoded categorical variables for modeling readiness

📊 Insight Examples
Insight	Observation
India has the highest count of Zomato-listed restaurants	Indicates strong platform usage in domestic market
Higher-priced restaurants generally receive better ratings	Suggests customer perception of value
Certain cuisines consistently score above average	Cultural influence on taste preferences
